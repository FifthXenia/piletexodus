** The Core Idea (production feeds)
- You track something in it's own particular feed, and publish an artifact to indicate proof-of-work.
** Why?
- Promote expression, heedfulness, honesty, over suppression, neglect, and self-destruction.
- *Establish trust, a track record, and continuity with one's values.*
** Explorations
- Further brainstorming, and explorations on this concept are located at: [[file:readme-exploratory.org]]
