*Purpose Existential:* ~Translate the above focused energy, to a designed flow, and vehicle for thriving.~

*Pronounced: `pea-lay exo-dus`*

** The Core Idea (production feeds)
- You track something in it's own particular feed, and publish an artifact to indicate proof-of-work.
** Why?
- Promote expression, heedfulness, honesty, over suppression, neglect, and self-destruction.
  - (suppresion results in wearing a mask, no boundaries, which results in resentment, a potpouri of comorbid illnesses, both mental and physical)
- *Establish trust, a track record, and continuity with one's values.*
** Explorations
- Further brainstorming, and explorations on this concept are located at: [[file:readme-exploratory.org]]
