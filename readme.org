*Pronounced: `pea-lay Exodus`*

---------

* The Core Idea (production feeds)
- You track something, and you publish either an artifact or something to indicate proof-of-work (in it's own particular feed).
** Tertiary Ideas (interaction, resources)
- You can subscribe to particular feeds, and mix and match them to a combined feed for browsing (if the feeds are public).
- You can provide money for every x things produced in a given feed.
** Core Principle:
- Promote ~Freedom of Action~ over ~Freedom of Speech not Reach~ (What Elon is doing with X)
  - (Speech often divides and keeps us trapped, triggered and isolated within our self-constructs and coping strategies (it's pure left-brain communication and interaction, references mainly the past and previous concepts, static, festering and rotting, loathsome, dead, not true, not the things themselves but the images, plato's cave, language requires a subject and object, division and separation is a fundamental axiom), where as creative action and expression is often expansionary, diffusive, connective, empowering, lowers tensions, and tears down walls dividing us (more right-brain, full-spectrum, higher bandwidth, wider view, parallel).)
* Why?
- Ensure momentum, consistency, accountability, and encourage others.
- Promote expression, over suppression.
- Prevent people from self-destructing from the inside out, and/or from severing their imagination and ability to stretch and strive, reverting to a mere existence centered around the inputs of the external and the depositions of their internal dialogue telling them to stay down like a trained dog and lick the boot that feeds them so they don't get kicked and punted across the room. Expanded horizons are possible.
- There should be a lane and place for those who wish to focus less on competition, and status, and domination, and instead focus more on expressing what they want to express, and living authentically and honestly according to their values. A chasm separating one from the relentless impositions of the outer world.
- The earth is full of a bunch of addicted humans (myself included). This will help cleanse their mind and spirit, and provide them with additional insight and room to breathe.
- Raise our standards of output, achievement, serenity, and satisfaction, collectively.
* How? (options)
- 1: Plain text tracking (~.org~ / ~.md~ / ~.rst~, ~.txt~), typically via habit tables.
  - (Or exports (could be redacted) from some sort of tracking system, such as [[https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock][org-timeblock]], [[https://github.com/ml729/org-habit-stats][org-habit-stats]], [[https://github.com/ml729/calfw-blocks][calfw-blocks]], [[https://github.com/Fuco1/org-timeliney][org-timeline]], [[https://github.com/dmitrym0/org-hyperscheduler][org-hyperscheduler]])
- 2: Browsable artifact feed by day for a particular action (say for art/music)
  - (This could maybe be uploaded via a plain text document, with headers for a given day containing a external link to the content artifact. Then this could be hosted at say like ~piletexod.us/user/art~ for a art feed, etc, and these feeds could be listed under their profile in the indexer.)
* Community Indexer (TBD)
- Indexer of individuals participating in this hosted at ~piletexod.us~
  - Add/Remove of individuals automated by their PRs and with merge bot rules.
    - (Need merge bots to avoid manual work, and to avoid something like this: https://github.com/zero-to-mastery/Animation-Nation/pull/1661)
  - Individual is removed from indexer after 30 days of no activity (no commits in their linked github piletexodus project)
  - (Maybe long-term set this up via a external server, that git clones people repos who are registered, processes their feeds, and hosts them (habit tracking, art, music, etc). If art uploaded say to ipfs or something, then iframe the content - display it from external. Tell people that you'll only process their repo say if it's less than 100MB or something, so that I have enough space to store everyone. So don't put images/videos/content in your piletexodus repo. Link to it externally. Just give me text, structure, and links. We'll process it, and host and present it under your username for you. Also host a readme for them.)
    - Or maybe host the indexer in a github actions/pages site, and have a github action/pages configuration that self-hosts individual sites on their accounts. If they go over the 5gb for their repo that github allows, they can use say ipfs for hosting. Or maybe also target gitea/forgejo self hosting as an option.
** Additional Fun Features:
*** Leaderboard:
**** (Hardcore) IronMan Mode, and just Generic
- Daily (Post every 2x days, otherwise dropped).
- Weekly (every 8 days latest).
- Sechs (6) (Every 7 days latest)
*** Challenges
- Add other users, to your allowed interactive users list. Then can do challenges (like weekly). Get reports (summaries) regarding everybodies completion, ranking in the competition.
*** Proof-Of-Work Integrations:
- Like for meditation, have a marketplace of verifiers (image recognition, make sure your in frame, etc), then output an attached approval/rejection regarding the successful completion of that activity.
*** Monetary subscriptions to feeds (to artifact production)
- If you like somebody who is making music or art, you can subscribe with a small amount per day, or something. Or queue it up per week (assuming daily post). Or maybe pay 0.00000001bitcoin/usd/20posts, or something.
  - (Current problem with say Github Sponsors, or Patreon, etc, is wtf am I paying for. How do I know I'm not just paying for your habit to diddle little children and eat cheetos? How do I know your even/actually doing anything? More transparency in output would help in this discernment, in to what exactly my investment is resulting in. So it works such that: I'm providing funding, given progress made in area x, via artifacts uploaded at y amount/frequency. I'm funding the process, less the outcome. The outcome will come.)
*** Wall of Ancestors
- Images of your ancestors, a blurb about them.
- Why: Inspires a spiritual legacy to your genes. Your ancestors were fighting, and produced you. So you have to keep going, and continue the fight, that they left to you. (Romans did this. Also any royal family, people that rule others, do this type of thing. Look at masons as well, it's the "Ancient Babylon Religion".)
*** Ability to subscribe/pin/favorite feeds.
- So you can view later.
- Or maybe also have a personal general feed, that fetches updates from all the feeds that you've favourited.
- RSS output per feed would be cool as well.
*** Custom Audio/MultiMedia Player
- Allow changing speeds with slider, increments that snap (0.75, 0.83, 1, 1.1, etc)
  - Have a star or something, that indicates the speed I like.
  - Option to play at a given speed I set by default.
- Ability to play with vocal tracks.
  - Vocal tracks appear below, you select what you want to play with beat.
- Ability to play some sort of multimedia with the music.
  - (Show picture, slideshow, animation, etc.)

* Others with somewhat similar conceptual overlap to note
** Action:
*** hadge
- https://github.com/ashtom/hadge
  - Created by the current (2023) Github CEO.
  - Github Action, exports exercise data, creates graph on github. Pretty cool. Similar idea to what I want to do.

- Could do something like this, but with the OSS local private android app [[https://github.com/OpenTracksApp/OpenTracks][OpenTracks]] (it supports automatic export, then rsync it out with a termux cron job, have something that processes the data, extracts just run time, pace, etc.)
  - export gpx from app, rsync it to a directory, then look at this: https://github.com/akroshko/emacs-otlb, find a way to extract distance, time, pace(min/mile).

*** awesome-pinned-gists
- https://github.com/matchai/awesome-pinned-gists
  - Very similar overlap. But not as much proof-of-work. Can only see general output progress, not actual raw artifacts produced.
*** https://github.com/yihong0618/2023
- Very similar to what I'm thinking.
  - Extra stuff here (prs, commits, etc).
  - Just indexing project name by just year, seems like a decent way to do things.
*** https://github.com/yihong0618/GitHubPoster
- Pretty neat. Proof-of-work is based on services. Or GPX one, can use local gpx files.
*** https://github.com/flopp/GpxTrackPoster
- gpx data heatmap.
*** https://yihong.run/
- This is nuts. I guess he's OK publishing his individual gpx routes.
  - Ways I could anonomize:
    - 1: Flatten to straight line, make time 00:00, remove elevation entries. (You have general proof of pacing, but don't know where I ran at, or when.)
       - https://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/158105/how-to-anonymise-a-gps-file
    - 2: Don't flatten, make time same date and 00:00. (So you have the gpx, you just don't know when I was there.)
