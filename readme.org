- *Goal:* ~Translate the above focused energy, into an engineered system, and a process for living.~
  - Taking those deep rooted stuck parts of ourselves 🏳️, & carefully transmuting the whirlpool 🌀, into beauty.

** The Core Idea (production feeds)
- You track something, and you publish either an artifact or something to indicate proof-of-work (in it's own particular feed).
** Why?
- Promote expression, heedfulness, honesty, over suppression, neglect, and self-destruction.
- *Establish trust, a track record, and continuity with one's values.*
** Explorations
- Further brainstorming, and explorations on this concept are located at: [[file:readme-exploratory.org]]
