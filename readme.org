** The Core Idea (production feeds)
- You track something, and you publish either an artifact or something to indicate proof-of-work (in it's own particular feed).
*** Core Principle:
- Promote ~Freedom of Action/Non-Action and Expression/Non-Expression~ over ~Freedom of Speech not Reach~ (What is being pushed over at X)
  - (Speech often reasserts lack and limitation and existing paradigms, so let's leave the option open for creative action and expression, and the expansionary and connective.)
** Why?
- Promote expression, heedfulness, honesty, over suppression, neglect, and self-destruction.
- *Establish trust, a track record, continuity with one's values.*
** How? (options)
- 1: Plain text tracking (~.org~ / ~.md~ / ~.rst~, ~.txt~), typically via habit tables.
  - (Or exports (could be redacted) from some sort of tracking system, such as [[https://github.com/ichernyshovvv/org-timeblock][org-timeblock]], [[https://github.com/ml729/org-habit-stats][org-habit-stats]], [[https://github.com/ml729/calfw-blocks][calfw-blocks]], [[https://github.com/Fuco1/org-timeliney][org-timeline]], [[https://github.com/dmitrym0/org-hyperscheduler][org-hyperscheduler]])
- 2: Browsable artifact feed by day for a particular action (say for art/music)
  - (This could maybe be uploaded via a plain text document, with headers for a given day containing a external link to the content artifact. Then this could be hosted at say like ~piletexod.us/user/art~ for a art feed, etc, and these feeds could be listed under their profile in the indexer.)
** Explorations
- Further brainstorming, and explorations on this concept are located at: [[file:readme-exploratory.org]]
