* The Idea
- You track something, and you publish either an artifact or something to indicate proof-of-work.
* Why?
- Ensure momentum, consistency, and accountability.
* How?
- Plain text habit tracking (~.org~ / ~.md~ / ~.txt~ table).
* Community (TBD)
- Indexer of individuals participating in this at ~piletexod.us~
  - Add/Remove automated my PRs and merge bots.
  - Individual is removed after 30 days of no activity (no commits in their linked github piletexodus project)
