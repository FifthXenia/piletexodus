*Purpose Existential:* ~Translate the above focused energy, to a designed flow, and vehicle for thriving.~
  - Refining our internal stuck roots 🏳️, and transmuting storms 🌪️, into serenity 🕊️. 
  - If you look at the vast majority of things that return to your present mind from your past - things you could call as regret, guilt, or "trauma", they are all situations, where you secretly knew in the back of your mind that there was a more difficult path/choice to take that was best, or more analysis/caution/pause/restraint/communication/openness that should have been taken, that you didn't take. You are reminded by this, because you did not go with the correct decision. You went with the "easier", quicker, rasher decision. And these correct decisions are often most always the more difficult one. So let's train ourselves to do the difficult work today, so we will be ready for the difficulties of the future, and so we can make the decisions that are best.

** The Core Idea (production feeds)
- You track something in it's own particular feed, and publish an artifact to indicate proof-of-work.
** Why?
- Promote expression, heedfulness, honesty, over suppression, neglect, and self-destruction.
- *Establish trust, a track record, and continuity with one's values.*
** Explorations
- Further brainstorming, and explorations on this concept are located at: [[file:readme-exploratory.org]]
